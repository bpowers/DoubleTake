    This program performs the following sequence of events:

    thread 1            thread 2
     (main)           (worker_main)

    pthread_create                
    malloc(array)                 

                      write(array)
                      free(array)

    write(array)

                      pthread_exit

    pthread_join
    exit

    This order-of-events is enforced through atomic reads + writes of
    a global sequence number, avoiding unspecified behavior as well as
    the use of mutexes, so that we don't trigger any intermediate
    epoch expirations.

    This is a classic use-after-free, and is properly identified as
    such by valgrind:

    ==15506== Invalid write of size 1
    ==15506==    at 0x4008B5: main (main.c:122)
    ==15506==  Address 0x53ed040 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 255 free'd
    ==15506==    at 0x4C2B1F0: free (in /usr/lib64/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
    ==15506==    by 0x400794: worker_main (main.c:86)
    ==15506==    by 0x4E3D333: start_thread (pthread_create.c:333)

    As well as tsan:
